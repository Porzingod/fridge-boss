# fridge-boss

Fridge Boss helps you keep track of your ingredients and gets recipe suggestions to help use them up.
Add ingredients to your inventory, apply filters and search.
Favorite any recipes you want to revisit.

A small application built using React + Redux and a Ruby on Rails API backend. I built this app to help keep track of ingredients and get recipes suggestions from the selected ingredients. This was my first project build using Redux together with React and I loved the two together. Thank you for checking out the video and/or project!
